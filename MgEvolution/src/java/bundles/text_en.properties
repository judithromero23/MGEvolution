primerosPasosText=At the age of 12, the world of hairdressing began to interest me since I worked in one. When I was 14 years old, I decided to train at an academy where I studied and worked until I started my own business.
comienzosText1=From an early age I have maintained contact with all kinds of formations in which little by little I have been meeting great professionals in the world of hairdressing and thanks to this I have made great friendships.
comienzosText2=At 17 I had already set up my own hairdresser and was autonomous, I took many risks since I was still a girl, but my devotion to this world filled me with the strength to continue. After 13 years of hard and passionate work I had to stop due to a problem that was beyond my strength.
comienzoText3=In that little break I continued my training to be always updated with the news both in cut, color, care and hair trends Due to the demand I had, I decided to set up a new hairdresser, hence the name, Evolution
actualidadText1=To this day I continue working in my business with much more experience than that 12-year-old girl. I have become a technician at the Eva Profesional hairdressing house, with which I have made several travel, giving courses and training other professionals.
actualidadText2=The world of hairdressing is a challenge every day and at 46 years old, I have to say, I am still passionate about it. I thank all the people who trust and put themselves in the hands of professionals because thanks to them I continue to grow.
